title: downmix 5.1 to stereo in ubuntu
---
# The description of the trouble  
Volume of some of sounds of .mkv files is too low to hear while that of the other is normal. For instance, the volumn of background music is normal, but the volumn of speech of characters is low.  

# Cause of the problem
There seems troubles like the one descripted above, though in my case, it is because of the player tries playing the files with 5.1 soundtrack when the output of the system is actually in 2.0 stereo.  

# Solution  
- config alsa plug  
```
$ sudo vim /etc/asound.conf
```
and write the following into the file and save
```
pcm.51to2 {
    @args.0 SLAVE
    @args.SLAVE { type string default "plughw:0,0" }
    type route
    slave {
        pcm $SLAVE
        channels 2
    }
    ttable {
        0.0= 0.3
        2.0= 0.3
        4.0= 0.18
        5.0= 0.21
        1.1= 0.3
        3.1= 0.3
        4.1= 0.18
        5.1= 0.21
    }
}
```
- config vlc player
```
Tool - Prefernce - Audio - Output
```
```
Output module: ALSA audio output
Device:        PulseAudio Sound Server
```
- restart
